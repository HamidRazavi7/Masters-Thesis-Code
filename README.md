# Thesis Abstract


The misuse of stimulant prescription medications poses a significant and escalating public health concern in the United States, particularly among young adults. Addressing this issue requires sophisticated methodologies capable of uncovering complex patterns and relationships in data. Geometric Deep Learning, a paradigm designed to analyze data with non-Euclidean structures, has achieved remarkable success across various domains, offering a powerful framework for tackling complex graph structure data challenges.
This study leverages Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to predict the likelihood of stimulant medication misuse using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Individuals are represented as nodes in a graph, while their relationships form edges, capturing social, behavioral, and contextual factors.
